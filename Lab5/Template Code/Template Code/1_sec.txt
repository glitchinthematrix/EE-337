;------ Template code for generating 1 sec delay
;------ Find the value of TH0, TL0 for which it produces a delay of 1/60 sec. 
;-------Use register R0 to count no. of times the timer should be reloaded to get the desired time period (0.33 sec, 0.66 sec and 1 sec). 
;------ Then if you change R0 to 40  it gives a delay of .66 sec and for R0 20 it gives a delay of .33 sec
