;-- Program flow to play musical notes.

;-- store the timer  values for each  musical notes in a look-up table(consecutive memory locations)
;-- Use Timer 1 for tone duration and Timer 0 for notes (frequency)
;-- First, initialise the Timers
;-- When one note duration finishes then update the timer 0 with new values
;-- keep monitoring the no. of notes to be played, when all notes are played (both ascending and descending) either
    you can stop both the timers or play the sequence all over again.

Hint
;-- for pause, you have to stop the timer0 for a particular duration
